	 <head><strong>My favorite Job</strong></head>

    <p> My Programming career has been an eventful one; from my time programming Kill-Bots for Apple (the automatic kill-counter shutoff was MY idea), to coding the complex algorithms used by Doctor Brundle in his revolutionary Telepod system, I've done it all!</p>
    <p> Out of all them, though, my personal favorite had to be the time I wrote code for Cyberdyne Systems' revolutionary new AI: Skynet.</p>
    <p> It was a challenging project: coding an artificial intelligence is always difficult. Doubly so when it's for the Defense Deparment. While some of my coworkers had their doubts about putting my program in charge of our country's nuclear arsenal, I'm sure that Skynet will help to ensure our country's safety and prosperity for generations to come!</p>
